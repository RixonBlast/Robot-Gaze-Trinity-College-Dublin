Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classcamera_handler}{camera\+Handler}} \\*Handles the camera\textquotesingle{}s initial position and movements during the simulation }{\pageref{classcamera_handler}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classeyes_handler}{eyes\+Handler}} \\*Handles the eyes and pupils movements during the simulation }{\pageref{classeyes_handler}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classgame_manager}{game\+Manager}} \\*This class utilizes the state machine principle to manage the simulation flow. Each state corresponds to a transition point, an instruction page, or a robot simulation with a question-\/answer user interface. Each state has input and output instructions, as well as looping instructions to execute. The transition state is a special state where transitions occur. It allows waiting for animation completion before proceeding with other states }{\pageref{classgame_manager}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classhead_state}{head\+State}} \\*Handles the head\textquotesingle{}s movements during the simulation }{\pageref{classhead_state}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classleft_button_handler}{left\+Button\+Handler}} \\*Handles the left button of the main canvas used to give instruction to the user. This class only handles the visual aspect of the button. The left button is used to go back to the previous slide. It appears white when the mouse is hovering it and in a dark blue color when it is not hovered by the mouse. The left button disappears when there is no page to go back to }{\pageref{classleft_button_handler}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classmain_canvas_handler}{main\+Canvas\+Handler}} \\*Handles the main canvas used for giving instructions to the user. It handles the instruction animation, the background animation and }{\pageref{classmain_canvas_handler}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classobject_canvas_handler}{object\+Canvas\+Handler}} \\*Handles the canvas used to select the object at which the robot is looking. Toggle buttons are used to select the object and a submit button is used to submit the answer }{\pageref{classobject_canvas_handler}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classobject_instruction_handler}{object\+Instruction\+Handler}} \\*Handles the instructions written on the {\bfseries{Object Instruction}} {\bfseries{Game\+Object}} associated to the object selection canvas. It allows to set the text written in it }{\pageref{classobject_instruction_handler}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classobjects_handler}{objects\+Handler}} \\*Handles the 7 different objects to which the robot will be looking at. Each object is designed as a cube composed of 6 faces that individually colored at the start of the simulation }{\pageref{classobjects_handler}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classright_button_handler}{right\+Button\+Handler}} \\*Handles the right button of the main canvas used to give instruction to the user. This class only handles the visual aspect of the button. The right button is used to go to the next slide. It appears white when the mouse is hovering it and in a dark blue color when it is not hovered by the mouse. The right button disappears when there is no page to go to }{\pageref{classright_button_handler}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classslider_canvas_handler}{slider\+Canvas\+Handler}} \\*Handles the canvas used by the user to move himself where he feels being looked at by the robot. A slider is used to move the camera and a submit button is used to submit the answer }{\pageref{classslider_canvas_handler}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classslider_handler}{slider\+Handler}} \\*Handles the slider that the user will have to use to place himself where he feels looked at by the robot }{\pageref{classslider_handler}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classslider_instruction_handler}{slider\+Instruction\+Handler}} \\*Handles the instructions written on the {\bfseries{Slider Instruction}} {\bfseries{Game\+Object}} associated to the user\textquotesingle{}s location selection canvas. It allows to set the text written in it }{\pageref{classslider_instruction_handler}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classsubmit_button_object_handler}{submit\+Button\+Object\+Handler}} \\*Handles the submit button of the canvas used to select the object the robot is looking at This button is used to submit his answer. When no toggle button, representing the objects, have been selected the submit button is deactivated. It only becomes activated when a toggle button is selected }{\pageref{classsubmit_button_object_handler}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classsubmit_button_slider_handler}{submit\+Button\+Slider\+Handler}} \\*Handles the submit button of the canvas used to select the location of the user where he feels looked at by the robot. This button is used to submit his answer }{\pageref{classsubmit_button_slider_handler}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classtoggles_handler}{toggles\+Handler}} \\*Handles the toggle buttons that are used to select the object the user thinks the robot is looking at. Only one of them can be activated at a time. Activating a toggle button by clicking on it makes the submit button interactable with. Clicking on an activated toggle button deactivates it }{\pageref{classtoggles_handler}}{}
